Wordcount implementation using Pig

1.	Create a Text File: 

Create a file input.txt with some sample text. 
E.g :-
Apache Pig is a high-level platform for big data. 
Pig simplifies processing. 
Data processing is efficient with Pig.

2.	Copy the File to HDFS: Open a terminal and execute 

hadoop fs -mkdir /user/cloudera/wordcount 
hadoop fs -put input.txt /user/cloudera/wordcount

3.	Type the code using text editor 

lines = LOAD '/user/cloudera/wordcount/input.txt' AS (line:chararray); 
words = FOREACH lines GENERATE FLATTEN(TOKENIZE(line)) AS word; 
grouped = GROUP words BY word; 
word_count = FOREACH grouped GENERATE group AS word, COUNT(words) AS count; 
STORE word_count INTO 'wordcount/output' USING PigStorage('\t');


4.	Save the file as pig1.pig

5.	Execute the pig script: 

6.	View the output: 
hadoop fs -ls /user/cloudera/wordcount/output 
 
hadoop fs -cat /user/cloudera/wordcount/output/part-r-00000
